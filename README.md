# Hermes FE (formerly known as `ngx-order`  )

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Getting started

- Install Node.js. To check which version you need, check the package.json > engines section (or visit https://angular.io/guide/versions).
- Install yarn by running `npm i -g yarn`.
- Run `yarn install`.


## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
This app expects a remote endpoint with a root url that is set in `src/assets/config.json`. To run the app with mocked (local) data, run `yarn start:local`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The `--prod` flag is by default enabled, so this will be a production build.
